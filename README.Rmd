# rsdistplot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rsdistplot is to allow users to generate random samples (rsdist) and plots of histograms (rshist) for the random samples of 4 different distributions: Normal("n"), t("t"), F("f"), Binomial("b").

## Installation

You can install the released version of rsdistplot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rsdistplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

rsdist("n", n = 1000, x = 6, y = 5, s = 1)

rsdist("n", n = 1000, x = 6, y = 5, s = 1, b = 2)

```{r example}
library(rsdistplot)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
rsdist("n", n = 1000, x = 6, y = 5, s = 1)
```

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
rshist("n", n = 1000, x = 6, y = 5, s = 1)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
